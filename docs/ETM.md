# ETM – Entity Title Mapper

ETM is a Home Assistant custom integration that observes configured source entities,
persists every title/state value it sees for that one source entity, and exposes a numeric enum sensor for automations.

## Watchers

Create one watcher per source entity through the Home Assistant config flow:

- **Name**: used for the output entity IDs.
- **Source entity**: entity to observe.
- **Artist attribute**: optional media artist attribute, default `media_artist`.
- **Watcher type**: `game`, `media`, or `activity`. Game and activity watchers prefer title-like attributes (for example `media_title`, `game_title`, `game_name`, `app_name`, or `activity`) before falling back to the entity state, so sources such as a PS5 entity store the actual played title instead of only a generic state like `playing`.
- **Retention days**: optional value used by manual cleanup; empty means unlimited retention.

## Persistence

Each watcher stores its entries through Home Assistant storage using keys named
`etm_<config_entry_id>`, which Home Assistant writes below `.storage/` at runtime.
Every stored entry contains:

- `key`
- `enum` (`0`–`9`, default `0`)
- `first_seen`
- `last_seen`
- `seen_count`

## Output entities

For a watcher named `PlayStation Titles`, ETM creates:

- `sensor.etm_playstation_titles_enum` – mapped enum value (`0`–`9`) for the current title.
- `sensor.etm_playstation_titles_raw` – current raw title/key string.
- `sensor.etm_playstation_titles_catalog` – diagnostic catalog entity whose state is the number of tracked titles; attributes expose `known_titles`, `mapped_titles`, and `unmapped_titles`.

## Panel

The sidebar panel **Entity Title Mapper** lists all watcher entries, shows unmapped
entries (`enum = 0`) first, lets admins assign enum values, and supports manual deletion.

Each watcher has its own title catalog. ETM does **not** create a new Home Assistant
device for every PlayStation title; instead, all observed or manually maintained title
variants are stored below the watcher and are exposed through the catalog sensor
attributes.

The panel provides two maintenance paths per watcher:

- **Add/update one**: map the current or manually typed title to an enum.
- **Import/update list**: paste a title list with one mapping per line, for example:

```text
Astro's Playroom = 1
Diablo IV = 2
Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart = 3
```

This lets a PlayStation title sensor keep a database of all played games while the main
output sensor only returns the enum for the title that is currently active.

## Services

### `etm.set_enum`

Create or update a key and assign an enum value. This can be used to pre-map a game/title before it is observed automatically.

```yaml
entry_id: "01J..."
key: "Astro's Playroom"
enum: 7
```

### `etm.import_entries`

Create or update multiple title mappings for one watcher.

```yaml
entry_id: "01J..."
entries:
  - key: "Astro's Playroom"
    enum: 1
  - key: "Diablo IV"
    enum: 2
```

### `etm.delete_entry`

Delete a key from a watcher.

```yaml
entry_id: "01J..."
key: "Astro's Playroom"
```

### `etm.clear_old`

Manually remove old entries. Omit `entry_id` to clean all watchers.

```yaml
entry_id: "01J..."
days: 30
```
